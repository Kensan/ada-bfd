The Ada-BFD is a library which provides Ada API for GNU Binutils BFD
library.  It works on any version of GNU Binutils (starting at 2.15).
The recommended version for GNU Binutils is at least the 2.22.

The Ada-BFD library allows to:

  - list and scan the ELF sections of an executable or object file,
  - get the content of the ELF sections,
  - get access to the symbol table,
  - use the BFD disassembler

The Ada BFD library is distributed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 2
(see COPYING).

The unit tests used by Ada BFD use the Ada Util and Ada Test Util libraries distributed
under the Apache License Version 2 (see testutil/LICENSE.txt).  They also use the
Ahven Unit Test Library distributed under the ISC license (see testutil/LICENSE.Ahven).
These unit test libraries are not installed.
