Installing and compiling Ada BFD
===============================

To compile Ada BFD you'll need:

 - an Ada compiler (GNAT or gcc 4.6).

 - the binutils 2.22 or higher installed for development.
   You need the bfd.h include as well as libbfd and libiberty.
   On Debian systems (including Ubuntu) install the development packages
   by using:

     sudo apt-get install binutils-dev
     sudo apt-get install libiberty-dev

   On NetBSD 6.1, you need to install by using:

     sudo pkgin install binutils-2.24nb3
     sudo pkgin install gettext-lib-0.19.2


Run the GNU configure command and build the library:

  ./configure
  make
  make check


You can install the library by using:

  make install
